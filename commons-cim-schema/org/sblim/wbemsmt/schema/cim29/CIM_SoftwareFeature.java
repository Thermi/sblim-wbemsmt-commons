 * Description: The CIM_SoftwareFeature class defines a particular function or capability of a product or application system. This class captures a level of granularity describing a unit of installation, rather than the units that reflect how the product is built or packaged. The latter detail is captured using a CIM_SoftwareElement class. When a SoftwareFeature can exist on multiple platforms or operating systems (for example, a client component of a three tiered client/server application that runs on Solaris, Windows NT, and Windows 95), the Feature is a collection of all the SoftwareElements for these different platforms. In this case, the users of the model must be aware of this situation since typically they will be interested in a sub-collection of the SoftwareElements required for a particular platform. 
 * SoftwareFeatures are always defined in the context of a CIM_Product, using the CIM_ProductSoftwareFeature association. Features are delivered through Products. Optionally, SoftwareFeatures from one or more Products can be organized into ApplicationSystems using the CIM_ApplicationSystemSoftwareFeature association.

     * (1) Is the physical package of the FRU compatible with the slots or equivalent packaging of the hardware? 
     * (2) Are there any physical constraints (such as power consumption) that prevent the FRU from being installed?

If it does, then the compatibility of each SoftwareFeature can be determined by evaluating the Check classes for the Software Elements that are part of the Feature (found by traversing the association, SoftwareFeatureSoftwareElements). For example, there might be a SoftwareElementVersionCheck that declares that a SoftwareElement (of the FRU's Software Feature) is not compatible with current software.

     * @param cimClient the WBEMClient for the communication
     * @param includeQualifiers If true, all Qualifiers for each Object (including Qualifiers on the Object and on any returned Properties) MUST be included in the Objects returned. If false, no Qualifiers are present in each Object returned.
     * @param includeClassOrigin If true, the CLASSORIGIN attribute will be present on all appropriate elements in the Objects returned. If false, no CLASSORIGIN attributes are present in the Objects returned. CLASSORIGIN is attached to an element (properties, methods, references) to indicate the class in which it was first defined.
     * @param role This string MUST either contain a valid Property name or be null. It filters the Objects returned to contain only Objects referring to the source Object via a Property with the specified name. If "Antecedent" is specified, then only Associations in which the source Object is the "Antecedent" reference are returned.
     * @param propertyList An array of property names used to filter what is contained in the Objects returned. Each CIMClass or CIMInstance returned only contains elements for the properties of the names specified. Duplicate and invalid property names are ignored and the request is otherwise processed normally. An empty array indicates that no properties should be included in the Objects returned. A null value indicates that all properties should be contained in the Objects returned. NOTE: Properties should not be specified in this parameter unless a non-null value is specified in the resultClass  parameter.
