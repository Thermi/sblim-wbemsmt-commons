     * Constants of property SupportedInputLocales
     * This property, along with locale properties in (for example) a SettingData class, specifies the locale for data consumed by a ManagedElement. 
     * A locale indicates a particular geographical, political, or cultural region. The SupportedInputLocales property is an array of strings whose entries specify one or more languages that can be used in the formulation of information input by a client. It may be defined by the ManagedElement or client as an input parameter to a method, as a Setting or SettingData property, or via other mechanisms. 
     * 
     * The SupportedInputLocales property publishes an element's support of various locales for input data. The first array entry MUST define the default locale (the natural language associated with the ManagedElement). If the SupportedInputLocales property is empty, it is assumed that the default locale is en_US (English). 
     * Each array entry consists of three sub-strings, separated by underscores: 
     * - The first sub-string is the language code, as specified in ISO639. 
     * - The second sub-string is the country code, as specified in ISO3166. 
     * - The third sub-string is a variant, which is vendor specific. 
     * For example, US English appears as: "en_US_WIN", where the "WIN" variant would specify a Windows browser-specific collation (if one exists). Since the variant is not standardized, it is not commonly used and is generally limited to easily recognizable values ("WIN", "UNIX", "EURO", etc.) used in standard environments. 
     * The language and country codes are required; the variant may be empty.
