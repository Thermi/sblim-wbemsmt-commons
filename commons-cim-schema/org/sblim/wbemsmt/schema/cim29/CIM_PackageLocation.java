 * Description: PackageLocation is a space/hole/shelf, possibly with mounting brackets or other connecting hardware, where other PhysicalPackages may be placed. This class describes an entity that holds something else and is not just a 'place' (as is conveyed by the CIM_Location object). This class has several corollaries to HostingBoard. Where a HostingBoard (backplane) has connectors/slots to describe the capabilities of holding additional PhysicalPackages, a PackageLocation is used to describe the same case for the general package, where there may or may not be no connectors. Examples of PackageLocations would include a disk cage in a tower PC or the chassis area where the power supply is mounted.
