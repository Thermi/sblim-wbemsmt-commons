  * Description: Capabilities is an abstract class whose subclasses describe abilities and/or potential for use. For example, one may describe the maximum number of VLANs that can be supported on a system using a subclass of Capabilities. Capabilities are tied to the elements which they describe using the ElementCapabilities association. Note that the cardinality of the ManagedElement reference is Min(1), Max(1). This cardinality mandates the instantiation of the ElementCapabilities association for the referenced instance of Capabilities. ElementCapabilities describes the existence requirements and context for the referenced instance of ManagedElement. Specifically, the ManagedElement MUST exist and provides the context for the Capabilities. Note that Capabilities do not indicate what IS configured or operational, but what CAN or CANNOT exist, be defined or be used. Note that it is possible to describe both supported and excluded abilities and functions (both capabilities and limitations) using this class.

It filters the Objects returned to contain only Objects associated to the source Object via an Association class in which the Object returned plays the specified role.

     * @param includeQualifiers If true, all Qualifiers for each Object (including Qualifiers on the Object and on any returned Properties) MUST be included in the Objects returned. If false, no Qualifiers are present in each Object returned.
     * @param includeClassOrigin If true, the CLASSORIGIN attribute will be present on all appropriate elements in the Objects returned. If false, no CLASSORIGIN attributes are present in the Objects returned. CLASSORIGIN is attached to an element (properties, methods, references) to indicate the class in which it was first defined.
     * @param propertyList An array of property names used to filter what is contained in the Objects returned. Each CIMClass or CIMInstance returned only contains elements for the properties of the names specified. Duplicate and invalid property names are ignored and the request is otherwise processed normally. An empty array indicates that no properties should be included in the Objects returned. A null value indicates that all properties should be contained in the Objects returned. NOTE: Properties should not be specified in this parameter unless a non-null value is specified in the resultClass  parameter.
